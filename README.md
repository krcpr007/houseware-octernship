## About me (Project submitter)
<p> I am Rajan kumar, currently pursuing B.tech from the National institute of technology Patna (NIT Patna). I have experience in full stack/MERN stack web development with strong hands on projects (see my portfolio website attached below). I am proficient with development, also done freelancing projects. I love to optimize web vitals, server side rendering, also worked with Bundlers, and multi-threading in javascript. Now I need real-world corporate practical experience.
I am attaching my resume and portfolio along with a GitHub link for you to look over.

## Assumptions
<ul>
<li>Lowercase and Uppercase character treated as same for only background color. Means background color of same alphabet will be same. For example, background color of 'A' and background color of 'a' will be same </li>
<li>Space as a character</li>
</ul>


### Small Bug 
<p>For generating the background color of character card I have written a function named as 'getBgColor' which is taking a character as input and generating a hex color code. The generated hex color code is same for same character but bug is that the generated hex color code by viewing the color is similar to the each other for some character, remember similar but not same. It means by viewing you can see that generated color is similar looking but their hex code is different </p>


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
